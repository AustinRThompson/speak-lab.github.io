\
I'm Austin, a speech scientist with a research interest in motor control of speech production in speakers with and without dysarthria. I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of Houston.

Outside of work, I love scary movies, travel, and my four-legged children.
